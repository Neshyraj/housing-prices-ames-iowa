# atm-withdrawal-amounts

Project completed November 6, 2017

Building a model to predict ATM cash demand

Group project with three other students for QBUS3820: Data Mining and Data Analysis at the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia with Dr. Minh-Ngoc Tran. Achieved lowest test MSE in course.

Some parts of Python code referenced and taken directly from class notes

ATM_Test/ATM_training - ATM Withdrawl amounts test and training data

document - Written report summarizing methodology and conclusions

full analysis - Processing, EDA, validation and modeling, ready to run. Saves final model in seperate file with pickle. Takes 3+ hours to run because of grid search CV for neural network

prediction_error - Final model run on test data and test MSE
