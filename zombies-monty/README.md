Project was done October 15, 2017

Mini MATLAB project at University of Sydney to practice coding and problem solving using computational methods

This project was done with one other student in COSC1003 Introduction to Computational Science with Dr. Tristram Alexander at the University of Sydney. The code is annotated, and the document file contains answers to various questions about the code.

document - written responses to assignment questions

montyhall - simulation for the famous Monty Hall Let's Make a Deal problem, where the contestant is asked to choose between 3 doors with 1 containing a car. The contestant chooses and Monty reveals a different door behind which is a goat. The contestant then has the option to switch from or keep their original door. The simulation is to computationally show the contestant must always switch to increase their chances of winning the car.

zombiesim - MATLAB code for a basic zombie apocolypse (with remission) simulation
